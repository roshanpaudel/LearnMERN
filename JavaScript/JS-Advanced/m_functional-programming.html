      // --- Imperative Approach (Before using Functional Programming) ---
      console.log("Before (Imperative Approach):");

      // A simple task list with an array of task objects.
      let tasks = [
        { id: 1, task: "Buy groceries", completed: false },
        { id: 2, task: "Walk the dog", completed: true },
        { id: 3, task: "Do laundry", completed: false },
      ];

      // Imperative approach: Looping through the tasks array and manually updating tasks.
      let updatedTasks = []; // To store tasks with completed status set to true.

      for (let i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
        if (tasks[i].completed) {
          updatedTasks.push(tasks[i]); // Manually push completed tasks into the new array
        }
      }

      // Update the task list with completed tasks
      tasks = updatedTasks; // Mutate the original array and assign the filtered tasks

      console.log(tasks); // Only completed tasks are left: [{ id: 2, task: 'Walk the dog', completed: true }]

      // Issues with Imperative Approach:
      // 1. **Mutation**: We're directly modifying the `tasks` array and using a `push` to update `updatedTasks`.
      // 2. **Manual Iteration**: We use loops and conditional checks, which can become difficult to maintain as the logic grows.
      // 3. **Harder to Extend**: Adding new features (e.g., toggling task completion) requires modifying the existing loop and logic.

      // --- Functional Programming Approach (After using Functional Programming) ---
      console.log("\nAfter (Functional Programming Approach):");

      // Functional approach using higher-order functions and immutable operations.

      const tasksFP = [
        { id: 1, task: "Buy groceries", completed: false },
        { id: 2, task: "Walk the dog", completed: true },
        { id: 3, task: "Do laundry", completed: false },
      ];

      // Functional approach with `filter` (for immutability) and `map` (for transformations)

      // 1. **Filter** the tasks to get only completed tasks (without mutating the original list).
      const completedTasks = tasksFP.filter((task) => task.completed); // No mutation, returns a new array

      // 2. **Map** over the completed tasks and format them.
      const formattedCompletedTasks = completedTasks.map(
        (task) => `${task.task} (completed)`
      );

      console.log(formattedCompletedTasks); // ["Walk the dog (completed)"]

      // Functional Approach Improvements:
      // 1. **Immutability**: We do not modify the original `tasksFP` array. Instead, we return new arrays using `filter` and `map`.
      // 2. **Cleaner and more declarative**: Using `filter` and `map` allows us to describe what we want to do with the data (filter completed tasks and format them).
      // 3. **Higher-order functions**: We used `filter` and `map` to create reusable functions that perform operations on the data without needing explicit loops.

      // --- Example of Adding Task Completion Toggle ---
      console.log(
        "\nAdding Task Completion Toggle with Functional Programming:"
      );

      // In the imperative approach, toggling task completion would require mutating the task's `completed` property.
      // In functional programming, we create a new updated task list instead of mutating the existing one.

      // Function to toggle the completion of a task by `id`.
      const toggleTaskCompletion = (tasks, taskId) => {
        return tasks.map((task) =>
          task.id === taskId ? { ...task, completed: !task.completed } : task
        ); // Create a new task list with the completion status toggled for the matching task
      };

      // Toggle the completion of the task with id 1 (Buy groceries)
      const updatedTasksFP = toggleTaskCompletion(tasksFP, 1);

      console.log(updatedTasksFP);
      // Output: [
      //   { id: 1, task: 'Buy groceries', completed: true },
      //   { id: 2, task: 'Walk the dog', completed: true },
      //   { id: 3, task: 'Do laundry', completed: false }
      // ]

      // Improvements with Functional Programming:
      // 1. **No Mutation**: We use `map` and spread syntax `{ ...task }` to create a new object with the updated completion status.
      // 2. **Pure function**: The `toggleTaskCompletion` function is a pure function, which means it doesn't modify any external state. It simply returns a new list with the toggled tasks.
      // 3. **Clear logic**: The logic is simple and declarative, which makes it easier to understand and extend.

      // --- Recursion Example for Task Filtering (Alternative to Loops) ---
      console.log("\nRecursion Example for Task Filtering:");

      // Here, we'll use recursion to filter tasks (an alternative to using loops like in the imperative example).
      const filterTasksRecursively = (
        tasks,
        predicate,
        index = 0,
        result = []
      ) => {
        if (index >= tasks.length) return result; // Base case: when index reaches the end of the array, return result array.

        if (predicate(tasks[index])) {
          result.push(tasks[index]); // If task passes the predicate, add it to the result.
        }

        // Recursive case: call the function again with the next index.
        return filterTasksRecursively(tasks, predicate, index + 1, result);
      };

      // Recursively filter tasks to get only the completed ones.
      const completedTasksRecursive = filterTasksRecursively(
        tasksFP,
        (task) => task.completed
      );

      console.log(completedTasksRecursive);
      // Output: [{ id: 2, task: 'Walk the dog', completed: true }]
      /**
       * Recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
       * factorial(n) = n * factorial(n - 1)
       * Example: factorial(5) = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
       */

      function factorial(n) {
        // Base case:
        // This is the condition that stops the recursion.
        // If n is 0 or 1, return 1. (Because 0! = 1 and 1! = 1)
        if (n === 0 || n === 1) {
          return 1;
        }

        // Recursive case:
        // Call the same function with (n - 1).
        // This breaks the problem down into smaller and smaller calls.
        return n * factorial(n - 1);

        /*
    Here's how the recursion works when you call factorial(4):

    factorial(4)
    => 4 * factorial(3)
    => 4 * (3 * factorial(2))
    => 4 * (3 * (2 * factorial(1)))
    => 4 * (3 * (2 * 1))    ← base case reached
    => 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
    => 24
  */
      }

      // Example usage:
      console.log(factorial(5)); // Output: 120

      // Improvements with Recursion:
      // 1. **Avoid Loops**: Recursion replaces traditional loops with self-calling functions, offering a more functional approach.
      // 2. **Cleaner Logic**: The recursive function makes the filtering logic more declarative and functional, as it doesn't rely on mutable state or side effects.

      // --- First-Class Functions in JavaScript ---
      // In JavaScript, functions are "first-class citizens", meaning:
      // ✅ They can be assigned to variables
      // ✅ They can be passed as arguments to other functions
      // ✅ They can be returned from other functions

      // Example 1: Assigning a function to a variable
      const greet = function (name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
      };

      console.log(greet("Alice")); // Output: Hello, Alice!

      // Example 2: Passing a function as an argument
      function saySomething(fn, value) {
        console.log(fn(value));
      }

      saySomething(greet, "Bob"); // Output: Hello, Bob!

      // Example 3: Returning a function from another function
      function multiplier(factor) {
        return function (number) {
          return number * factor;
        };
      }

      const double = multiplier(2);
      console.log(double(5)); // Output: 10

      // All of these demonstrate that functions in JavaScript are treated just like any other value (first-class).

      // --- Example of a Higher-Order Function ---

      // A Higher-Order Function is a function that takes another function as an argument (or returns one).

      // Let's say we want to greet someone politely, but we want to customize the greeting style.

      // Here's a basic function that prints a greeting:
      function casualGreeting(name) {
        return `Hey, ${name}!`;
      }

      function formalGreeting(name) {
        return `Good day, ${name}.`;
      }

      // Now here's our HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTION:
      function greetUser(name, greetingFunction) {
        // We pass in a name AND another function that defines how we greet
        console.log(greetingFunction(name));
      }

      // Using the higher-order function with different greetings
      greetUser("Alice", casualGreeting); // Output: Hey, Alice!
      greetUser("Bob", formalGreeting); // Output: Good day, Bob.

      // 💡 Why is this helpful?
      // - We can reuse `greetUser` with any greeting style.
      // - We keep the greeting logic separate and flexible.

      // ✅ This is a simple and powerful example of a Higher-Order Function in action!
